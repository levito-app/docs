### Risks

Providing funding for traders carries risks, even though we do our best to hedge against that risk through varies methods, but you must know this is not 100% risk free. One **major source of risk** is the price discrepancy when supported exchanges go offline on their end, another would be the incorrect pricing data provided by said exchanges in the event of a catastrophic market crash.

### Hedging risk

We implement a proprietary algorithmic hedging strategy to protect potential downside risk by monitoring constantly the imbalances between overall long vs short positions, so that when a trading loss is realized on the trader's side, the funding provider's (pod manager) capital is over protected.

### Profit share

Any profit made on your exchange account through our trading portal, excluding fees, is subject to a 30%/70% split, you will keep 70% no matter what loss buffer or profit share you have in your pod policy.

### Trading fees

Both trading fee and funding fee (if applicable) will be credited to your [levito.app](http://levito.app) balance once a trading session is settled.

### Management

As a funding provider (pod manager), you need to actively manage your pod (where your capital lives), whenever a trading session is complete and in accounting mode, you have to review it and generate a receipt by clicking on that specific session link in your pod history panel, you will also have to transfer funds between [levito.app](http://levito.app) and your exchange accounts in case needed.

If this is a problem for you, you might want to consider [staking](/funding/staking), so that we can manage it for you.

### How to apply

You must have at least \$1,000.0 on your exchange account as well as a matching \$1,000.0 on your [levito.app](http://levito.app) account for trade settlement requirements.
