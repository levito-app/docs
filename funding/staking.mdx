### Difference between Staking and Funding

By [providing funding](/funding/provider), most of your capital is in your own exchange account, you just provide the API access, then you get 70% of whatever profit generated with your account. You do not hold any entitlement to profits generated elsewhere, and you have to actively manage your trading pod.

Staking is depositing your full capital and let us manage it, through both exchange account funding and active investments.

### How to stake

After depositing, you can stake immediately in your account, it is the same as you were buying any cryptocurrency, there is a price and a fee when you stake or redeem, naturally, the price will change depending on trading activity, and yes, it is tradable but only when enough funding is raised before the general public can participate.

### Who can stake

Right now anyone can stake but there is a minimum staking requirement, when enough funding is raised only accounts with investor access can stake, and staking requirement is expected to be higher and holding period longer.

### Revenue Streams

1. Funded Account Profits
2. BITCOIN, BNB, SOL accumulation

### Supply Inflation and Deflation

Staking is inflationary by design, so that founders and previous investors are better incentivized to re-invest and bring in new ideas to increase revenue streams. However to manage market dilution, we will implement staking thresholds to control new funds entering the system. The capital raised is deployed to fund funded trading accounts, and also allocate to accumulate cryptocurrencies using the DCA approach in spot market. Profits and realized gains from these revenue streams will strategically be used to buy back and retire the inflated supply, creating a deflationary pressure.

_When investors redeem their tokens, the inflated supply will be retired from circulation._

### Math (Estimation)

**Quarterly net profit target** is profit after 70% reduction of return generated by funded account operation (Already paid to investors). This heavily depends on how many active traders are trading at any given time and the speed they realize their gain/loss, because our propriatary hedge engine we are able to capture both the upside and downside profit with minimal risk, so we are certain that this profit estimation is healthy.

| Supply    | Stake    | Token Acquired | Inflation | Accumulated Inflation | Ownership | Ownership Dilution | Quarterly Net Profit Target |
| --------- | -------- | -------------- | --------- | --------------------- | --------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1,000,000 | \$10,204 | 20,000         | 2%        | 2%                    | 1.96%     | 2%                 | (\$600) 6%                  |
| 1,020,000 | \$10,408 | 20,000         | 1.96%     | 4%                    | 1.92%     | 0%                 | (\$600) 6%                  |

Notice as more capital are being staked, inflation rate decreases for the same amount of token, yet our quarterly net profit target remains the same, eventually we will have a very positive token price impact.
