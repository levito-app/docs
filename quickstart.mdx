## Main Roles

All roles can be setup in the same user account. However providing funding for traders need to be approved by management.

### Trader

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Evaluation (Eval)" icon="check-double">
    You can join a trading pod and start using capital provided by pod managers, there are 3 tiers you can choose from, normally you would start with tier 1, other tiers are upgradable from previous tier so you don't have to pay the full tier price.

    After you pay the eval fee of the tier you selected, you can then subscribe to any available pods within that tier and immediately use the funds within each pod to start trading.

    ## Tiers

    1. This tier has the largest loss buffer to give you room for trading error, that is why as a beginner, you should always start here. As this tier is the most risky for pod managers this is why profit sharing is normally in their favour.
    2. The second tier provides little to no loss buffer but gives the trader more share of the profit, this tier is upgradable by management who oversees all trading activities, when you show enough evidence of a profitable trader, you will be automatically upgraded.
    3. The final tier, pod managers of this tier provide no loss buffer but give you an attractive profit share, it is upgradable from tier 2.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Eval credit" icon="credit-card-blank">
    The first time you buy a tier status (in this example, tier 1), you by default get a -3000 USDT equivalent in loss credit, which means if the total loss you generated through trading surpasses 3000 USDT, your tier status will be revoked. You can always repurchase but it is recommended that you improve your trading style before continuing.

    You can find someone that has our referral code when you buy, which usually will give you more credit, sometimes up to -8000 on top of the default credit, depending on the person's own referral level.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exchanges & Trading Symbols" icon="bitcoin-sign">
    Levito.app offers two centralized exchanges: 1) Binance, 2) OKX, for executing trades, but it can also depend on what exchanges pod managers use.

    ### Trading Symbols

    We are actively adding and removing symbols based on their risk profile, any trading symbol that may incur huge funding fee will not be included here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fees" icon="credit-card">
    Basically you pay fees as you would on normally on any other exchanges.

    ### Trading Fee

    This fee is deducted from your margin amount and returned to pod manager to cover their side of fee. Because you are essentially using their trading account.

    ### Funding Fee

    Funding fee, if applicable, will be combined with trading fee, as funding fee could be negative or positive.

    ### Liquidation Fee

    Exchanges charge liquidation fee, normally 1.5% \* leverage, we do not charge this fee.

    ### Eval Fee

    This is charged when you purchase a tier status, it covers a predefined loss amount, which will be used to hedge any potential losing position automatically to cover any additional loss beyond your margin amount.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Margin" icon="dollar-sign">
    You will need to put up a margin amount required by specific pod, this is called first-loss capital, where in case of a loss, you will cover that risk fully with your capital, or any additional loss buffer your pod manager offers. 

    There is no maintenance margin required as it is covered by pod manager in order to maximize your utilization of available margin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tokenizing your trade" icon="arrow-down-up-lock">
    You can tokenize your trade, in such a case, your trade is locked in an agreement with public investors/traders who can contribute to your margin size, further boosting your fund utilization and profit, at the same time reducing your loss to only your margin amount.

    After placing such a trade, your trade will show up within 30 minutes so that investors/traders can participate (do not require tier status), they can long and short your trade, betting on whether your trade will reach take profit target or liquidation level. 

    The more people you can attract to contribute, the more profit potential you command, the less risk you take with respect to public margin that is allocated to you, and you also collect the trading fee.

    <Note>
      Locked in an agreement means you can not set stop loss, only take profit, the stop is your liquidation level, you won't be able to change this fact, unless people invest in your trade which can push liquidation further depending on size of trade.
    </Note>

### Fund Provider (Pod Manager)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is pod manager" icon="album-collection-circle-user">
    Pod manager is like a fund manager, you provide funding for traders, and get a profit split when a trade is profitable. But you will actively check whether or not a trading session is complete so that you can adjust your funds on your exchange accounts, get fee rebates and do some accouting by transfering funds from and to levito.app and exchanges.

    ### When in loss

    Traders provide the first-loss capital in form of security deposit, just like on any other exchanges, when a trade incurrs loss, their security deposit will cover that loss first, any additional loss after that is covered by a backend automated trade hedging system that constantly monitors all trading activities and hedge bets accordingly.

    ### How to fund

    Funding has two aspects, 1) is you deposit funds, usually a little bit more than the promised funding amount in your exchange trading accounts. 2) then you deposit the same amount in your levito.app account. This way when traders have profit, the system can immediately transfer this fund over to traders when accounting is complete.

    ### How to apply

    Currently we are not open to outside investors as we have internal investors who can cover the initial investment, as clients grow, we are sure to open for public funding. But always drop us a proposal.
