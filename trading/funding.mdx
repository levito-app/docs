### Terminology

- Margin - The capital that you have in order to get funding
- Funding Account - Trading account on an exchange
- Eval Fee - Evaluation fee paid in order to use funding accounts
- Coverage - The amount you can lose before you need to pay eval fee again
- Loss Buffer - The extra percentage of amount you can lose beyond your margin
- Profit Share - The amount you keep once profitable
- Tokenize - In order for public micro traders/supporters to add to your margin
- Pod - One trading pod can have one or multiple funding accounts under one policy

### Maintenance margin

Because funding account is always larger than your margin amount, your margin will not be used to cover this amount, and also, in 99.9% of cases, even when you get liquidated, liquidation fee is not charged.

### Trading fee and funding fee

You pay trading fee and funding fee as you normally would on any crypto exchange. This fee will be credited to fund provider to cover that cost.

### Evaluation fee

There are 3 tiers, normally you would start at tier 1, because it is the cheapest and offers the best loss buffer as well as more generous coverage. We don't charge this fee on a fixed recurring basis, we only charge it when you lose past the coverage.

There are 3 parts to this fee

1. Affiliate reward
2. Other operating expenses
3. Accumulation of a few selected coins so we can attract more investment for funding

### What happens after you've paid eval fee

You can now subscribe to any public funding account as long as it is within your tier, for example, you can subscribe to 5 or 10 such funding accounts and use them to trade on [levito.app](http://levito.app) as you normally would on any other exchange.

Once it says your coverage is exhausted, you must repay this fee in order to start using it again.

If you are consistently profitable, our system will upgrade you to the next tier, which can give you access to more favorable profit share and funding amount.

### What happens when trade is closed

When trade is closed, the trading account will be in an accounting state, fund provider will start to review and rebalance account, then a transaction receipt will be generated for record keeping, you as well as fund provder can see what funds, how and why they are moved.

Once above is all done, trading account will be set to normal, ready to trade again.

### How will my margin be used

Different funding account requires different margin amount, once trading starts, your margin will be frozen until trade is closed. When you lose, you lose your margin first then loss buffer provided by that funding account, when you take profit, your share of it will be transfered to you automatically when transaction receipt is generated.

### What if funding provider closes my trade

This is a violation of our policy, any loss resulted will be paid from that providers security deposit. If that happens again, their funding will be removed.

### What happens if destination exchange is down

If destination exchange is down, which then results in loss, each participating party bears their own share of that risk.
